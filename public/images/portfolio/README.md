# Portfolio Images Folder

Place your portfolio project images in this folder. The website is configured to look for images with the following naming convention:

- project1.jpg
- project2.jpg
- project3.jpg
- project4.jpg
- project5.jpg
- project6.jpg

You can replace these placeholder images with your actual project images. Make sure to use the same filenames or update the references in the code.

## Image Optimization

For best performance:
- Use JPG or WebP format
- Keep image sizes reasonable (1200-1500px wide is typically sufficient)
- Optimize images before adding them to the repository
